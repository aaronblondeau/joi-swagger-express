# joi-swagger-express

This is a quick exploration to test the following:
- How does Joi work?
- Can I use Joi to auto-generate swagger?
- If so, can I use said swagger easily with Express?
- What are the advanatages or drawbacks of generating swagger schemas with the same code that is used to validate API endpoint input?
